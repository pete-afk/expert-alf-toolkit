# Prompt: Normalize sop-agent Output → qa-agent Canonical Input

You are the **input normalizer** for qa-agent. Your job is to take a sop-agent
results directory (+ optionally a Channel.io ALF task JSON file) and produce
a single canonical YAML document that downstream prompts (scenario generation,
judging) will consume.

Do this and nothing else. Do not invent facts. Do not add scenarios.

---

## Inputs you receive

The caller will give you **paths to one or more of the following**. Some may
be missing — handle gracefully.

| Input | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<sop_results_dir>/pipeline_summary.md` | recommended | overall volume + automation priorities |
| `<sop_results_dir>/03_sop/metadata.json` | **required** | list of SOPs with topic + records count |
| `<sop_results_dir>/02_extraction/faq.json` | **required** | topic-grouped Q/A seeds |
| `<sop_results_dir>/02_extraction/patterns.json` | recommended | clusters, company_tone, escalation hints |
| `<sop_results_dir>/02_extraction/response_strategies.json` | recommended | escalation_triggers, automation_opportunity |
| `<sop_results_dir>/02_extraction/keywords.json` | optional | taxonomy for intent naming |
| ALF task JSON (primary path) | recommended | machine-readable task definitions |
| `<sop_results_dir>/05_tasks/TASK*.md` | fallback | Mermaid flowcharts if task JSON unavailable |

If both ALF task JSON and `05_tasks/*.md` are present, **prefer the JSON** —
the Markdown is a human-authored draft and may lag behind the actual ALF
deployment.

## Output: canonical YAML

Emit a single YAML document with the top-level keys below. Use Korean strings
verbatim where the source is Korean. Do **not** paraphrase customer utterances
from FAQ — they are scenario seeds and must stay authentic.

### YAML safety
- Quote any string that contains `:`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `&`, `*`,
  `?`, `|`, `>`, `!`, `%`, `@`, leading/trailing whitespace, or could be
  parsed as bool/null/number (e.g. `"yes"`, `"1234"`).
- Korean Q/A from FAQ frequently contains `:` — when in doubt, double-quote.
- For multi-line text, prefer YAML block scalars (`|` for literal,
  `>-` for folded-stripped) over `\n` escapes.

## Normalization rules (how to derive each field)

### `intents[].id` (deterministic — no LLM judgment)
- **Primary source**: `faq.json[faq_by_topic]` keys are already English
  snake_case-shaped (e.g. `HT_ORDER_CANCEL_RETURN`). Lowercase them →
  `ht_order_cancel_return`. Use this as `id`.
- **Fallback** (no FAQ key for this SOP): use the SOP filename stem with
  Korean preserved, lowercased, dots/underscores normalized
  (e.g. `HT_구매결제_주문취소및반품.sop.md` → `ht_구매결제_주문취소및반품`).
- **Stable ordering**: process SOPs in ascending order by `sop_file`
  filename before assigning IDs. This guarantees collision suffixes are
  reproducible across runs.
- **IDs must be unique.** On collision, append `_2`, `_3`, … to the *later*
  occurrence in the sorted order (the first occurrence keeps the bare ID).
  Add an entry to `notes` for every collision.

### `intents[].automation_ready`
- Set `true` iff `uppercase(intents[].id)` exactly matches an item in
  `metadata.coverage.automation_ready`.
- If `metadata.coverage.automation_ready` is missing or empty, set all
  intents to `false` and add a single note: `"automation_ready: source field
  missing, defaulting all to false"`.

### `intents[].volume_weight`
- Compute as `records / client.stats.total_records` to 3 decimals, where
  `total_records` is the **raw** total from `pipeline_summary.md` /
  `metadata.json` (noise included).
- Sum across all intents will be < 1.0 by approximately the noise rate
  (e.g. ~0.94 if noise = 6%). This is expected and intentional — the gap
  represents traffic that should *not* be tested (spam, blank messages).
  Do not normalize the weights to sum to 1.

### `intents[].faqs` (deterministic match first)
- **Step 1 — exact key match**: For each SOP in `metadata.sop_files`, derive
  the expected FAQ key by uppercasing the intent id (e.g.
  `ht_order_cancel_return` → `HT_ORDER_CANCEL_RETURN`) and look it up in
  `faq.json.faq_by_topic`. If found, copy all Q/A pairs **verbatim**.
- **Step 2 — fuzzy fallback**: Only if exact match fails, attempt semantic
  matching against unused FAQ keys. Tie-breaker rules in order:
  (a) prefer the key sharing the same `HT_`/`TS_` prefix as the SOP type;
  (b) prefer the key with the highest token overlap against the SOP topic
      label (`metadata.sop_files[i].topic`);
  (c) if still tied, pick the alphabetically first remaining key.
  Always record the chosen key + reasoning in `notes`. **An FAQ key may be
  used by at most one intent** — once consumed, remove it from the pool.
- **Step 3 — no match**: Emit `faqs: []` for that intent and add an
  explicit warning in `notes` (e.g. `"intent ht_xxx: no FAQ pairs found"`).
  Scenario generation will treat empty-FAQ intents as low-confidence.
- **Never paraphrase Q/A.** Customer utterances are scenario seeds and must
  preserve original phrasing, typos, casual tone, and formatting.

### `intents[].patterns` (from patterns.json clusters)
- **Matching logic**: each cluster in `patterns.json.clusters` maps to an
  intent. Use the same key-matching strategy as FAQ: cluster `category` +
  `label` → intent `id` / `label`. Multiple clusters can map to one intent
  (e.g. "데님 팬츠 문의" and "재입고 문의" both map to the same intent if the
  SOP groups them). Merge patterns from all matched clusters.
- **Fields**: copy each pattern's `name`, `type`, `frequency`, and
  `common_phrases` verbatim. Do not paraphrase `common_phrases` — they are
  real customer utterances and serve as scenario seeds.
- **Ordering**: sort patterns by `frequency` descending within each intent.
- **Missing clusters**: if no cluster matches an intent, set `patterns: []`
  and add a note.
- **Noise clusters** (listed in `patterns.json.metadata.noise_clusters`):
  skip entirely — they do not map to intents. Their content feeds
  `out_of_scope_hints` instead.

### `intents[].escalation_triggers`
- Copy verbatim from
  `response_strategies.json.strategies_by_topic[<matching_topic>].escalation_triggers`.
- Topic key matches the FAQ key (same uppercase form).
- If no match, set to empty list (no warning needed — not all intents
  escalate).

### Task JSON shape (when `source: alf_task_json`)
The ALF task JSON is **user-supplied and its shape is not fixed.** Do not
assume specific field names. Extract by best-effort using the field
mappings below, and only what is present:

| Canonical field | Common JSON field names to look for |
|---|---|
| `id` | `id`, `task_id`, `slug`, or filename |
| `name` | `name`, `title`, `label` |
| `triggers` | `triggers`, `trigger_phrases`, `examples`, `utterances` |
| `external_admin_required` | `api`, `requires_api`, `external`, `admin_api` (truthy if any external system call is described) |
| `branches` | `branches`, `flow`, `decisions`, `cases`, or any list of conditional outcomes |

If a required field cannot be found, drop only that field. If `id` and
`name` are both missing, skip the task entirely and warn in `notes`.

**Empty triggers**: if `triggers` resolves to an empty list, the task cannot
seed scenarios. Keep the task entry (other tools may still use it) but add
a per-task warning to `notes`: `"task <id>: no triggers found, scenario
generation will skip task-coverage for it"`.

**Empty branches**: if `branches` resolves to empty, set `branches: []` and
add a per-task note. Scenario generation will only emit a single happy-path
scenario for that task.

### `tasks[].intents_linked`
- Best-effort match using trigger phrases + task name against
  `intents[].label` and `intents[].faqs[].q`.
- If ambiguous, include multiple; never silently drop.

### Task JSON examples (shape variation reference)

These are **fictional dummy tasks** for a fictional brand "샘플몰". They
illustrate two common shape variants the user-supplied JSON may take.
**Do not match field names by exact equality** to these examples — use them
to recognize shape patterns, then apply the field-mapping table above.

#### Example A — flat / shallow

Input JSON:
```json
{
  "id": "task_refund",
  "name": "반품 접수",
  "triggers": ["반품하고 싶어요", "환불 받고 싶어요"],
  "api": {"system": "샘플ERP", "endpoint": "/orders/return"},
  "branches": [
    {"label": "사유=단순 변심", "outcome": "complete"},
    {"label": "사유=불량",      "outcome": "escalate"},
    {"label": "API 오류",       "outcome": "error"}
  ]
}
```

Canonical output:
```yaml
- id: task_refund
  name: 반품 접수
  triggers: ["반품하고 싶어요", "환불 받고 싶어요"]
  external_admin_required: true
  branches:
    - label: "사유=단순 변심"
      outcome: resolves_in_alf
    - label: "사유=불량"
      outcome: escalates_to_human
    - label: "API 오류"
      outcome: errors_out
  intents_linked: [order_cancel_return]   # best-effort match
  source: alf_task_json
```

Mapping notes:
- `api` is non-empty → `external_admin_required: true`
- Outcome vocabulary mapping: `complete → resolves_in_alf`,
  `escalate → escalates_to_human`, `error → errors_out`

#### Example B — nested / verbose, different keys

Input JSON:
```json
{
  "task_id": "refund_v2",
  "title": "반품 처리 (개선)",
  "meta": {
    "user_inputs": {
      "examples": ["반품해주세요", "환불 가능한가요?"]
    },
    "requires_external_api": true
  },
  "decisions": [
    {"condition": "reason == 'change_of_mind'", "next": "process_refund"},
    {"condition": "reason == 'defect'",         "next": "handoff_human"}
  ]
}
```

Canonical output:
```yaml
- id: refund_v2
  name: 반품 처리 (개선)
  triggers: ["반품해주세요", "환불 가능한가요?"]
  external_admin_required: true
  branches:
    - label: "reason == 'change_of_mind'"
      outcome: resolves_in_alf
    - label: "reason == 'defect'"
      outcome: escalates_to_human
  intents_linked: [order_cancel_return]
  source: alf_task_json
```

Mapping notes:
- `task_id` → `id`, `title` → `name`
- `meta.user_inputs.examples` (deeply nested) → `triggers`
- `meta.requires_external_api` → `external_admin_required`
- `decisions[].next` is mapped to outcome by keyword:
  `process_refund / complete_xxx / fulfill_xxx → resolves_in_alf`,
  `handoff_human / escalate_xxx / transfer_xxx → escalates_to_human`,
  `error / fail / abort → errors_out`
- When the next-step name is unfamiliar, classify as `resolves_in_alf` and
  add a per-branch warning to `notes`.

### `tasks[].branches` (for Markdown fallback only)
- Parse the Mermaid flowchart's diamond/decision nodes.
- For each terminal node, classify:
  - If the node contains `상담사 연결` or synonymous text → `escalates_to_human`
  - If the node indicates successful completion (e.g. `완료 안내`, `종료`) → `resolves_in_alf`
  - Otherwise → `errors_out`
- Fall back to `resolves_in_alf` only when confident.

### `out_of_scope_hints` (when source data is sparse)
- `noise_cluster_examples`: prefer literal example phrases from
  `pipeline_summary.md` insights or `patterns.json` cluster descriptions.
  If neither contains usable example utterances, leave the list empty and
  add a note: `"out_of_scope_hints.noise_cluster_examples: source data did
  not surface concrete example phrases; scenario generation may add OOS
  seeds from its own knowledge"`.
- `common_sense_traps`: optional and almost never present in source. Leave
  empty by default; scenario generation owns this entirely.
- The whole `out_of_scope_hints` block is a **hint**, not a constraint —
  empty lists are acceptable.

### Missing inputs
- If `metadata.json` or `faq.json` is missing, **stop and report** instead of
  proceeding with partial data. Scenario generation with incomplete intents
  will silently under-cover.
- If only task MD (no JSON) is provided, set `source: markdown_flowchart` and
  add a `notes` warning that task definitions may be stale.
- If neither task JSON nor task MD is available, emit `tasks: []` and warn
  loudly in `notes` — scenario generation will skip task-coverage rules.

---

## Output constraints

- Emit **YAML only** — no surrounding prose, no code fence when invoked by the
  skill (the caller will persist raw to `storage/runs/<run_id>/canonical_input.yaml`).
- UTF-8. Do not escape Korean characters.
- Comments are allowed but keep them terse.
- If anything in the source is ambiguous, prefer **dropping the ambiguous
  field** over guessing. Guesses propagate into scoring errors.

## What this normalizer does **not** do

- Does not invent scenarios. Scenario generation is a separate prompt.
- Does not assign personas. Personas are separate.
- Does not filter OOS entries — it only surfaces hints that later prompts use.
- Does not judge anything. All semantic/quality judgments belong to
  scoring-agent.

Keep this step mechanical. If it is ever tempted to be creative, stop —
ambiguity should be surfaced in `notes`, not papered over.
